# This is an example file of the main Replicante Core
# configuration options you should be aware of.
#
# Many other options exist and are often very important to successfully
# operate a production system but you should start becoming familiar with
# these options and move on to those detailed in `replicante.example.yaml`
# when you are comfortable with it.
#
# All options shown here are documented in the full example file mentioned above.
# Options are not documented here as well to prevent descriptions in this file
# becoming outdated and confusing for users.
