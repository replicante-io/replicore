title: Cluster tags
---

Support arbitrary user tags on clusters.

This can be used to:

  * Search for clusters by tag (in the UI).
  * Create reports/notifications per tag (tag all clusters needed by an app,
    when any of them fail notify of possible impact to the app).
  * ID clusters by datacenter/availability zone (helpful to detect large scale outages).
